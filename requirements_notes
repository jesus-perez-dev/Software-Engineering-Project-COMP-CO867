Requirements Notes

##Must Have

Connect to the API/Simulator while PLCSim is running
Don’t have to create the PLC, just hook into it
Can assume PLC is already created, can assumed it already named something constant
API can iterate through and pick one
Being able to switch the PLC between run mode and stop mode
One: process program
Other: Do not process program
Detect whether its running or stopped
Start the simulator if it is currently stopped
Getting input and outputs from PLC, asking for those from the API, and sending back input values
Proof of concept that retrieves ~16 outputs and ~16 inputs (can be lights/buttons on HMI)

##Functional##
Any specific features from the API are must-haves? Anything features we can exclude?
Answer: 
Use IO addresses rather than tags

=>>> Everything else we should be able to do from TIA portal
    Avoid blocking API calls
    Ideally, process through the real-time running simulation so we can run the PLC on screen and have it respond
    Make compatible with analog (and digital of course) devices, to send and receive values
    Can just pass in min/max of raw values
Should the library API support simulating multiple controllers at once?
    Answer: If we have time, support multiple controllers, but only aim for 1

###Game Questions
-> What are the inputs, how do students interact with it? (switches? something else?)
    Answer: Physical items that can be hooked into sensors that the PLC can read from, eg an on/off switch
    -> What kind of graphical/game design are you thinking?
    Answer: Prof example: Jumping over a rolling log: have the simulator detect (input) the log approaching/rolling over a sensor, then the character should jump in response to avoid it
Prof suggests finding a game and re-using it to take inputs/output from the simulator
    -> What is the game supposed to teach the players?
    Answer: Students should program the PLC from the portal, and game should read/write IO in response to the program that is currently loaded/running on the portal/simulator

###Reliability
Any logging you want?
    Retrieve errors if possible - Keep an action log to help with debugging errors/crashes

###Performance 
Requirement: Having it be able to respond real-time 
    Should not take a “long time”
What kind of system would this be running on?

###Supportability
Will other people in the future be using this library to create new apps/games? 
    Answer: would be using ladder logic programs already in TIA or prof would supply a ladder logic program for us
Do you think this library will be extended/modified by others in the future
    Answer: Yes, may be modified per-assignment

##Housekeeping
When/how can we get TIA Portal activation codes?
    Would get us codes soon
    Use version 16 trial, only need DVD-1
        TIA Portal
        PLC SIM Advanced (regular PLCSIM has different API)
Should we create accounts on Siemens website now?
    Yes for sure
Can you provide resources for learning PLC programming concepts?
    Would get us stuff soon

##Conceptual Questions: Confirm or deny?
The simulator simulates the PLC microcontroller?
    Yes, uses ladder logic
Our game code defines a PLC program, loads it to the simulator, and tells the simulator to execute, using the API?
    Our API simply connects to PLC simulator that has logic from the TIA portal
Our game shows representations of the inputs/outputs to the PLC simulation?
    Yes eg. lights and switches on HMI (board with buttons)
Our game code provides inputs, the simulator provides outputs?
    Yes
Inputs/Outputs are On/Off states, or analog states?
    Should support analog

##Known Requirements
Creating a simplified library/interface to Siemens TIA Portal / PLC Simulator
Prof wants it easier to initialize IO/interact with PLC
Can use either C# or C++
Prof would like game as a proof-of-concept of the library
Windows only for development (simulator is not cross platform)
